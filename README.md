# PEPSI
PEPSI (Polarised Electron Proton Scattering Interactions) is a Monte Carlo generator for polarised deep inelastic scattering (pDIS). It is based on the LEPTO 6.5 Monte Carlo for unpolarised DIS.

# Installation

Can be built using "make".
The "install" target should be customized to your environment before using

Ignore warnings of the form:
```
 Warning: $ should be the last specifier in format
```
 Which should be okay (it is a g77 extension allowed by gfortran).
 As well as:
```
Warning: Deleted feature: PAUSE statement at (1)
```
This feature is deleted in F95; here, it should eventually be replaced by write() + read().

# CHANGES 
Multiple warnings like this:
```pepsi/setctq5.F:9.10:
     >   './pdf/cteq5hj.tbl',                                           
          1
Warning: Initialization string starting at (1) was truncated to fit the variable (16/17)
```

indicate a too short variable length. Changed to
```fortran
      Character Flnm(Isetmax)*100
```
in line 6 (of setctq5.F).


# Running
Note that the executables expect the pdf/ directory 
in the directory of execution. Easiest way to achieve this is a softlink (adapt to your location)
```sh
ln -s $EICDIRECTORY/PACKAGES/PEPSI/pdf
```

You can test with things like
```sh
./pepsieRHICnoRAD < STEER-FILES/input.EW_noradcor.eic.posi.test
```

# Known Issues
DO NOT TRY radiative corrections. Currently does not work.

With radiative corrections, you would also need a subdirectory
```sh
mkdir radcorr
```

Tables can be generated:
```sh
mkdir radgen
./pepsieRHICwithRAD < STEER-FILES/input.data_make-radcor.eic.pol.anti
```

But they cannot be used.
```sh
./pepsieRHICwithRAD < STEER-FILES/input.data_radcor.eic.pol.anti
